ATEC Watering Hole - featuring Mr. Frieder Nake	http://www.utdallas.edu/calendar/event.php?id=1220414248	Academic	2 p.m.-4 p.m.	2 p.m.	Algorithmic and Aesthetics – On Digital Images
Frieder Nake
University of Bremen & University of the Arts Bremen, Germany
Abstract: Computer art is now about 50 years old. As in McLuhan’s famous slogan, its early attempts were examples of the medium being the message. The algorithmic principle, essence of computing science, became the driving force for this approach to art. We will review important events and examples of the first years of computer art. It established itself as a very special aspect of conceptual art. Only with interactive art, however, digital art gained enough of autonomy and started formulating its own aesthetic questions. We will take a look at generative aesthetics, and show some, perhaps surprising, connections to the broad stream of art history, e.g. Monet, Mondrian, Pollock, Albers, Götz, G. Richter.
Biography:  Frieder Nake is a mathematician who happens to be called an artist, but a computer scientist as well. The second is trivial, the first not quite. He has done early pioneering work in computer art. He is a professor of interactive computer graphics and digital media, teaching at the University of Bremen, Germany, and the University of the Arts Bremen. He has taught in Canada for some years, and many more countries, Norway and China among them. He was recently one of many nominees for the new Visionary Pioneer of Media Art award of Prix Ars Electronica.
